description: In the Paris of the first half of this century there was no darker, dingier,
  or more forbidding quarter than that which lay north of the Rue de Rivoli, round
  about the great central market, commonly called the Halles. The worst part of it,
  perhaps, was the Rue Assiette d'Etain, or Tinplate Street. All day evil-looking
  loafers lounged about its doorways, nodding lazily to the passing workmen, who,
  blue-bloused, with silk cap on head, each with his loa under his arm, came to take
  their meals at the wine-shop at the corner; or gossiping with the porters, male
  and female, while the one.
